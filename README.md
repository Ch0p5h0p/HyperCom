# HyperCom
A secure relay chat

I liked IRC. IRC was a really neat concept. My only problem was that it wasn't secure. Kinda hard to enjoy something when it isn't secure. In response to this, I'm creating HyperCom, a protocol inspired by IRC that maintains security.

Right now, HyperCom is effectively just a secure IRC protocol. In the future, I'll be adding more things to it, such as:
- parent servers (one server collects others)
- private P2P messaging
